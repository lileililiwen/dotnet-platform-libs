# Release governance

Production projects under `src/` are packable platform packages. Samples,
tests, and templates are excluded from the package inventory. Package metadata,
symbols, embedded sources, deterministic builds, and the repository README are
defined in `Directory.Build.props`.

## Versioning and compatibility

The default package version is `0.1.0`; a release must pass an explicit
`Version` or `VersionPrefix` override. Use SemVer: additive compatible changes
are minor, fixes are patch, and reviewed breaking changes are major. Breaking
changes require migration notes and a reviewed API-baseline update in the same
change. The selected public contract baseline is checked by:

```bash
./scripts/check-public-api.sh
./scripts/check-public-api.sh --update  # only in a reviewed release change
```

Record user-visible changes in `CHANGELOG.md` before publishing. Package
signing and SBOM generation are release-environment responsibilities; their
evidence must be attached to the release and unavailable evidence is not a
pass. No workflow publishes packages or changes versions without an explicit
release trigger.

## Verification

```bash
./scripts/quality-gate.sh
./scripts/conformance.sh
./scripts/audit-packages.sh
```

The default package source is the Huawei Cloud NuGet v3 mirror, selected for
mainland-China build reliability. Override it for an approved internal feed or
the official source without editing the repository:

```bash
NUGET_SOURCE=https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json ./scripts/audit-packages.sh
```

The source is used for restore, packed-consumer verification, and vulnerability
metadata lookup. The audit uses NuGet restore-time scanning for all direct and
transitive dependencies at high severity. A mirror that does not expose current
vulnerability metadata must be treated as `UNVERIFIED`; it is never silently
accepted as a clean audit.

The conformance fixture consumes packed local NuGet artifacts, not project
references. The audit script reports `AUDIT_STATUS=UNVERIFIED` when its service
cannot provide evidence and exits non-zero unless explicitly overridden for a
non-release diagnostic run.
