## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Package-feed consumer fixture

The conformance suite SHALL restore platform packages from a locally produced package feed in a separate consumer fixture and SHALL not use cross-repository project references.

#### Scenario: Packed consumer restore
- **WHEN** the suite packs the platform and restores the fixture
- **THEN** the fixture compiles against package artifacts and can be tested independently from platform project references

### Requirement: Registration and replacement verification

The suite SHALL verify opt-in registration, consumer replacement of replaceable services, absence of unrelated provider dependencies, and deterministic options validation.

#### Scenario: Consumer override
- **WHEN** the fixture registers an application implementation after platform defaults
- **THEN** the application implementation is resolved and the platform default does not hijack the contract

### Requirement: Runtime safety verification

The suite SHALL cover health/readiness, safe failure classification, cancellation, tenant isolation where applicable, and bounded diagnostics for each supported adapter.

#### Scenario: Provider unavailable
- **WHEN** an adapter provider is unavailable in a deterministic fake
- **THEN** the fixture verifies the documented fail-open/fail-closed result and confirms that secrets are absent from diagnostics

### Requirement: Environment blocker reporting

The verification workflow SHALL distinguish source failures from unavailable Docker, databases, credentials, external providers, or package feeds and SHALL record the exact failed command and next action.

#### Scenario: Docker unavailable
- **WHEN** an integration gate cannot start its required container
- **THEN** the workflow reports an environment blocker without claiming the source implementation passed or failed
